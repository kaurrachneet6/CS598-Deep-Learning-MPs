Problem 1: Implementation of fully connected neural network from scratch using numpy

Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). The neural network should be trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent. Target accuracy on the test set: 97-98%
