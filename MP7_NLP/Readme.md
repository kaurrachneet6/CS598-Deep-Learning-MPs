**Problem 7: Sentiment Analysis for IMDB Movie Reviews**

This assignment will work with the Large Movie Review Dataset and provide an understanding of how Deep Learning is used within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will train models to detect the sentiment of written text. More specifically, we will try to feed a movie review into a model and have it predict whether it is a positive or negative movie review.

The assignment starts off with how to preprocess the dataset into a more appropriate format followed by three main parts. Each part will involve training different types of models and will detail what you need to do as well as what needs to be turned in. The assignment is meant to provide you with a working knowledge of how to use neural networks with sequential data.
* Part one deals with training basic **Bag of Words** models.
* Part two will start incoporating **temporal information by using LSTM** layers.
* Part three will show how to **train a language model** and how doing this as a first step can sometimes improve results for other tasks
