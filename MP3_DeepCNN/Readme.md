**Problem 3: Implementation of Deep CNN for CIFAR 10**

Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset. The convolution network should use dropout, trained with RMSprop or ADAM, and data augmentation. Also, compare dropout test accuracy using the heuristic prediction rule and Monte Carlo simulation.
