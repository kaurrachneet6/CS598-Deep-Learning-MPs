The goal of this project is to introduce you to the computer vision task of image similarity. Like
most tasks in this field, it’s been aided by the ability of deep networks to extract image features.

The task of image similarity is retrieve a set of n images closest to the query image. One
application of this task could involve visual search engine where we provide a query image and
want to find an image closest that image in the database.

Your task, for this project, will be to implement a simplified version of the pipeline introduced in
“Learning Fine-grained Image Similarity with Deep Ranking”.
